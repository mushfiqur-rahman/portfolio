      "Why you Should to purchase Mail Service or Cloud from Main provider, not reseller.",
    content: `Many people purchase Google Workspace or Microsoft 365 from resellers. But that’s often not a good idea.\n
Buying directly from Google or Microsoft ensures you get the full feature set, better support, and complete control over your subscription.\n
Resellers may limit access to admin settings, billing, or security options.\n
🔑 1. Better Support and Faster Response
When you buy from the main provider, you’re tapping into official support channels—chat, phone, or email—directly with trained professionals from Google, Microsoft, or your chosen provider. On the other hand, with resellers, support is often slower, limited, or not as reliable.

✅ Main Provider: 24/7 dedicated support, official documentation, escalation options.
❌ Reseller: Delays, lack of in-depth knowledge, no escalation authority.\n
🛡 2. Data Security and Privacy
Your data is everything. Buying directly ensures your terms of service and privacy policies are with the actual provider—not a middleman.

When you go through a reseller, you may unknowingly grant them admin access to your email, files, or cloud dashboard, posing serious privacy risks.\n
🔄 3. Full Control Over Your Account
Resellers often set themselves as the primary admin or billing owner, limiting your ability to manage your own account. This can be problematic when:

- You want to migrate
- Upgrade plans
- Add new users
- Change DNS records or domain ownership

With the main provider, you’re in full control from Day 1.\n

💸 4. Transparent Pricing and Billing
Main providers offer clear, consistent pricing, and often include promos or discounts. Resellers may add hidden fees or overcharge for simple tasks.

You might be paying more without knowing it.\n

🚫 5. Migration & Exit Restrictions
Planning to move to another service or switch domains? Resellers can make migration harder by:

- Locking your domain or dashboard access
- Withholding admin credentials
- Charging extra to release your account

When you buy direct, you’re free to migrate, cancel, or upgrade any time—no friction, no penalty.\n

⚙️ 6. Direct Access to New Features
Main providers roll out new features and updates instantly. Resellers may delay access or restrict usage based on their own setup.

Get the latest productivity tools, AI features, and integrations right away—when you go direct.\n

🧠 Final Thoughts
While resellers may offer convenience or bundles, that ease can come with long-term limitations. For full control, maximum security, and guaranteed support, it’s always better to purchase your mail or cloud service directly from the main provider.

Don't risk your business operations for short-term savings.
Go direct. Stay in control. Grow with confidence.
